# Random2D
To train a simple perceptron model to classify a set of randomly generated patterns Using Python .
Using sigmoid function.
Creating two random datasets 
first data sets x1 and x2 values ranges form 0.5 <= x1 <= 0.5 and -0.5 <= x2 <= 0.5
second data set is between two circles with radius of 3 and 4with the center of the coordinate.
target is -1 
initial weights are taken randomly between 2 and -2.
